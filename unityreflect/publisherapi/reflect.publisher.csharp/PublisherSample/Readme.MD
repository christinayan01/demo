# PublisherSample
This is a small project that showcases how to use the Publisher API in about 100 lines of code.
This "tiny exporter" creates hardcoded models and sends them to Reflect, using the C# Reflect API, and can be launched either in GUI or in console mode.

For more information about the Reflect API, see the README file at the root of the repository.

## Command line parameters
* `GUI` to use GUI mode ; otherwise, will open in console mode.
* `sync` to run a sync flow ; otherwise, will run a simple export flow.

## Rules
In this sample is an example of rules file (rules.json) that you can use as a template to build your own rules.
See our Publisher API Overview for more details about the Conditions and Actions you can use.
